# Shadows-of-Other-Worlds


We propose an extended theoretical framework in which the conventional quan-
tum wavefunction is generalized to encompass a multiversal landscape. In this
formulation, interference effects arising from parallel universes introduce subtle yet
measurable deviations in quantum measurement outcomes. This paper rigorously
develops a suite of theorems quantifying these cross-universal interference terms,
analyzes their scaling properties and robustness in the presence of decoherence,
and explores the potential implications for the foundations of quantum theory. De-
tailed mathematical derivations, simulation studies, and extensive discussions on
experimental realizations are presented. The predicted anomalies, while faint, offer
a promising experimental pathway for testing a testable extension of the Many-
Worlds Interpretation, with profound consequences for our understanding of reality
and the development of multiverse-aware quantum technologies.
